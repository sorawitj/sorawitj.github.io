I'm a last year PhD student in Statistics at [ETH Zürich, Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs) supervised by [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/). I am currently interning at Apple in the Health AI team working with [Christina Heinze-Deml](https://christinaheinze.github.io/).

During my PhD studies, I had the opportunity to spend time at Carnegie Mellon University's [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and Harvard University's [Statistical Reinforcement Learning lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html).

I completed my master’s degree in Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), during which I worked with [Ricardo Silva](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/). Prior to the master’s study, I worked as a data scientist at [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/) for four years. I received my bachelor’s degree in Statistics from [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/).

My research interest lies in the intersection between Causality, Invariance and Robustness in Machine Learning.
