I've just completed my PhD from [ETH Zürich, Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs), where I was supervised by [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/). I am now a research scientist at Apple in the Health AI team.

During my PhD studies, I spent some time at Apple working with [Christina Heinze-Deml](https://christinaheinze.github.io/). I also spent my first two years at [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) and did a research visit with [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/) at Carnegie Mellon University's [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and with [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/) at the [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html), Harvard University.

I completed my master’s degree in Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), during which I worked with [Ricardo Silva](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/). Prior to the master’s studies, I worked as a data scientist at [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/) for four years. I received my bachelor’s degree in Statistics from [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/).

My research interest lies in the intersection between Causality, Invariance and Robustness in Machine Learning.
