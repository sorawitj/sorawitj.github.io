I'm a last year PhD student in Statistics at ETH Zürich, Seminar for Statistics. Previously I was a PhD student at Copenhagen Causality Lab, University of Copenhagen. I'm co-supervised by Jonas Peters and Niklas Pfister. During my PhD I was fortunated to visit Pradeep Ravikumar at Carnegie Mellon University's Machine Learning Department and Susan Murphy at the Statistical Reinforcement Learning lab, Harvard University.

I completed my master’s degree in Machine Learning at University College London in 2019, during which I worked with Ricardo Silva. Prior to the master’s study, I worked as a data scientist at Agoda for four years. I received my bachelor’s degree in Statistics from Chulalongkorn University in 2014.

My research interest lies in the intersection between Causality, Invariance and Robustness in Machine Learning.
