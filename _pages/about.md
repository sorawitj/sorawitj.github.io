I am a Research Scientist at Apple Zürich working on machine learning for health with a particular focus on causal inference and distributional shifts. I earned my PhD from the [ETH Zürich, Seminar for Statistics](https://math.ethz.ch/sfs) under the supervision of [Jonas Peters](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~jopeters/).

During my PhD studies, I interned at Apple working with [Christina Heinze-Deml](https://christinaheinze.github.io/), spent my first two years at [Copenhagen Causality Lab](https://cocala.github.io/) and did research visits with [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/) at Carnegie Mellon University's [Machine Learning Department](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and with [Susan Murphy](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/) at the [Statistical Reinforcement Learning Lab](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~samurphy/lab/overview.html), Harvard University.

I completed my master’s degree in Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where I worked with [Ricardo Silva](http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucgtrbd/). Prior to the master’s studies, I spent four years as a Data Scientist at [Agoda](https://www.agoda.com/), applying machine learning at scale. I completed my Bachelor's degree in Statistics at [Chulalongkorn University](https://www.chula.ac.th/en/).

My research lies in the intersection of causality, invariance, and robustness in machine learning, with the goal of developing more reliable models for health-related applications.
